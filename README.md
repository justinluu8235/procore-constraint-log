# Procore Constraint Log 

Procore has many options for tracking issues - RFIs, observations, punch lists, etc. A big portion of the construction project management workflow is on the platform.

One that many general contractors find themselves recreating trackers in dozens of internal excel and google sheets are tracking for constraints within small groups such as internal groups (GC electrical team, GC curtainwall team, etc) or within reoccuring focus meetings (such as BMS SWAT meeting). Many times we find we'll have one tracker per reoccuring meeting - at one point i had about 8 of them. 

The constraint log will be viewed and access only within the small group, and will be used as "meeting minutes" or a format for the small team to stay focused and communicate clearly on BICs, target dates, next steps, and priority levels. Avoid having an efficient format be determined by who happens throw together the excel minutes.
